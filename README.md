# Voices Unheard: The Bechdel Test 

### Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Final Project "Voices Unheard: The Bechdel Test" for the Introduction to Data Science chair at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). This repository contains all the codes, data, and resources used to build the project, which examines gender representation in cinema using the Bechdel Test as the primary evaluation tool.

### Repository Structure

- /data: Contains raw and processed data collected from (insert api names and whatever here).
- /statistics: Describes all the mathematical and statistical tests conducted in the project, providing a quantitative, evidence-based evaluation of the data.
- /scripts: Includes all scripts used for data collection, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.  A /requirements.txt file and further instructions are provided to ensure replicability.
- /results: Contains the output of all analyses, including: visualizations (graphs showing trends in gender representation), statistical results (outputs from tests such as Chi-Square and regression analysis) and summary tables of key findings.

### Data

Our project uses data from the following sources:

- Bechdel Test API: Determines whether films pass the Bechdel Test based on three criteria.
- IMDb: Provides metadata such as title, release year, genre, and country.
- Box Office Mojo: Contains financial information to analyze the economic impact of gender representation in cinema.
- Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic: Offer critical and audience reviews for an additional perspective on film reception.

To ensure replicability, /data also:
- Explains the data extraction process from the various APIs and methods used and
- Describes all the mathematical and statistical tests conducted in the project, providing a quantitative, evidence-based evaluation of the data

### Scripts

For the best use of the scripts found on this repository, you should start by checking the \requirements.txt file found on this folder.
We advise you to grab the data sample to compile your code at /data but also feel free to extract your own data by your own parameters/needs/filters as instructed at /data_collection.

Key scripts include:
-
-
-
-
- /math.py: Runs various statistical tests, such as Chi-Square, regression analysis, and correlation tests. Further explanation and listing of all tests can be found at /statistics.

### Results

The results of the analysis, including all visualizations and summary tables, are available in the /results directory. These are organized by the specific research questions addressed in the study.

### Contributing
