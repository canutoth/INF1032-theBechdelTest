# Voices Unheard: The Bechdel Test 

### Overview

Welcome to the repository for *Voices Unheard: The Bechdel Test*, a project for the Introduction to Data Science chair at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). This repository contains all the codes, data, and resources used to build the project, which examines gender representation in cinema using the Bechdel Test as the primary evaluation tool.

***

### Repository Structure

> **/data:** Contains raw and processed data collected from (insert api names and whatever here).
> 
> **/scripts:** Includes all scripts used for data collection, data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.  A /requirements.txt file and further instructions are provided to ensure replicability.
> 
> **/results:** Contains the output of all analyses, including: visualizations (graphs showing trends in gender representation), statistical results (outputs from tests such as Chi-Square and regression analysis) and summary tables of key findings.

***

### Data

Our project uses data from the following sources:

- Bechdel Test API: Determines whether films pass the Bechdel Test based on three criteria.
- OMDb: Provides metadata such as title, release year, genre, and country.

To ensure replicability, `/data` also:
1. Explains the data extraction process from the various APIs and methods used and
2. Describes all the mathematical and statistical tests conducted in the project, providing a quantitative, evidence-based evaluation of the data

### Scripts

For the best use of the scripts found on this repository, you should start by checking the `\requirements.txt` file found in this directory.
We advise you to grab the data sample to compile your code or to extract your own data by your own parameters/needs/filters as instructed at /data.

**Key scripts include:**

- `APIRequestManager.swift`: Defines a singleton class `APIRequestManager`, which manages two arrays: one for `WelcomeElement` objects and another for `CompleteMovie` objects. It ensures a single shared instance of the class can be accessed throughout the app.
- `ContentView.swift`: Defines a `ContentView` that displays a button for users to fetch movies. When the button is clicked, it triggers an asynchronous task that retrieves movies using the BechdelTest API, then fetches detailed information for each movie from the OMDb API. The retrieved movies are classified by country and by decade, and relevant data is printed to the console for further analysis.
- `Models.swift`: Contains the model of the results returned by the BechdelTest api merged with the OMDb API. 
- `apiRequest.swift`: Sends a request to the BechdelTest API and, for each film returned, make a subsequent request to the OMDb API to retrieve additional details about the film.
- `infoPList.xcprivacy`: Allows the app to make insecure HTTP requests to `omdbapi.com` and its subdomains.
- `math.py`: Runs various statistical tests, such as Chi-Square, regression analysis, and correlation tests. Further explanation and listing of all tests can be found at /data.

### Results

The results of the analysis, including all visualizations and summary tables, are available in the `/results` directory. These are organized by the specific research questions addressed in the study.
